// The nextSequence() function is almost where all the magic happens, here, first, the function will generate a random number and it will help us to selected a random color inside var buttonColors array and store it inside the var gamePattern.

// The text of the webpage title will change to "Level" + level, the current number of var level is equal to 1, so it will show 1 once nextSequence() function is called.

//Then theres the var gamesQty, that will help us to run the next myLoop() function, inside our nextSequence() function. myLoop() function will help us to repeat every color that var gamePatterns has stored inside it, so it will remember the player what colors have already been called. 

//Inside myLoop() we have a setTimeOut() function will help us to have a delay everytime a color is repeated to the user so it will be more easy to remember. Inside it, it will make every button stored in gamePattern to have a fadeout and reproduce their specific sounds, once executed, it will add +1 to var gamesQty, with the help of var gameQty it will be possible to select every index inside var gamePattern to repeat them.

//If the number stored in var gamesQty is less than the var gamePattern length, it will execute myLoop() again, this is very helpful to repeat every color stored inside var gamePattern, once the number of var gamesQty is equal or bigger than var gamePattern length, the function will stop.

//At the end, the nextSequence() function will add +1 to var level, increasing it by 1 everytime nextSequence() function is called, and resetting var userClickedPattern array to and empty array, this will help because we need the player to repeat all the colors everytime the the level change.

//And our last function, the checkAnswer() function, first it will check and compare indexes between gamePattern and userClickedPattern using level as an input, if the last color generated by the game and the last color selected by the player are the same, it will console.log "success" but, thats not all, to call nextSequence() function (that is what keeps running our game), it also need to met another requirement, the userClickedPattern length MUST be exactly the same as gamePattern length, this is obviously because this means that the player repeated the same pattern as gamePattern stored colors.

//If none of the above requeriments is met, then else is where the player is heading, where it console.log "wrong", it shows in the webpage title that the game is over, also creating a flashing red background, reproducing the gameOverSound() function and calling startOver() function, that resets all the progress already made.
